**Due**: Thursday, June 6th by 11:59 PM

Acknowledgment: The idea for this assignment comes from [Tom Ellman](http://pages.vassar.edu/tomellman/) at Vassar College.

CS 201 - Assignment 2
=====================

Getting Started
---------------

Downlaod [CS201\_Assign02.zip](CS201_Assign02.zip). Import it into your Eclipse workspace (**File&rarr;Import&rarr;General&rarr;Existing Projects into Workspace&rarr;Archive File**.)

You should see a project called **CS201\_Assign02** in the Package Explorer.

Your Task
---------

Your task is to complete the implementation of the **Disk** class. (In the next assignment, you will use your **Disk** class to implement a game that will use this class.)

An instance of the **Disk** class represents one of the disks placed on the game board. Each **Disk** object should store the **x** and **y** coordinates of the disk's center, a **radius**, and a color (represented as member of the **DiskColor** enumeration). You should add fields to the class for each of these 4 properties.

You must implement 7 methods:

-   A constructor which initializes the fields of a newly-created **Disk** object using values specified by parameter values
-   A **getX** method which returns the **Disk** object's center x coordinate value
-   A **getY** method which returns the **Disk** object's center y coordinate value
-   A **getRadius** which returns the **Disk** object's radius value
-   A **getColor** method which returns the **Disk** object's color
-   An **overlaps** method which determines whether or not the **Disk** object overlaps another **Disk** object passed as a parameter
-   An **isOutOfBounds** method which determines whether or not the **Disk** object partly or completely lies outside the bounds of the rectangular game board

Each method is described by a comment which explains, in detail, how the method should work.

A JUnit test class called **DiskTest** is provided. Make sure that all of the tests pass before you submit the completed assignment.

Hints
-----

The formula for computing the distance between two points is

You can compute the square root of a **double** value using the **Math.sqrt** method.

## Submitting

When you are done, submit the assignment to the Marmoset server using one of the methods below.

### From Eclipse

If you have the [Simple Marmoset Uploader Plugin](../resources.html) installed, select the project (**CS201\_Assign02**) in the package explorer and then press the blue up arrow button in the toolbar. Enter your Marmoset username and password when prompted.  Make sure your choose **assign02** as the inbox:

> ![Choosing assign02 as the inbox](img/assign02/inbox.png)

This is the recommended way to submit your work.

### From a web browser

Save the project (**CS201\_Assign02**) to a zip file by right-clicking it and choosing

> **Export...&rarr;Archive File**

Upload the saved zip file to the Marmoset server as **assign02**. The server URL is

> <https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset/>

Use this method only if there is some reason why you can't use the plugin.

### After you submit

**Very important**: After you submit the assignment, please log into the Marmoset server (<https://cs.ycp.edu/marmoset>) and check the files you submitted to make sure that they are correct.

*It is your responsibility to make sure that you have submitted your work correctly.*
