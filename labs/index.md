This page lists the lab activities.

In order to receive credit for completing a lab, you need to get a sign-off from your instructor *in person*.  There are two options for this:

1. For 100% of full credit: Get a sign-off by the end of the *next* class (i.e., the class that follows the one in which we work on the lab in class.)
2. For 80% of full credit: Get a sign-off sometime before the next exam.

<div class="callout">
<b>Protip</b>: Work on the labs <i>before</i> coming to class.  This will allow you to ask good questions when we work on the lab in class, and will give you a much better chance of finishing the lab in class.
